# Simulation-Game-Cameras
A system of camera controls for simulation games created with Unity3d

This is actually a collection of usuable cameras that will hopefully, eventually include the 
ability to switch between them in-game.  It will also, hopefully, ultimately exist in version 
for both the old and new input systems.
